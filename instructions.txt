There are 2 folders named Jaimin and Mukul folder, they have:
 - History Data
 - Audio Features Data
 - History Analysis
 - Audio Features Analysis

Also, there is a Comparitive Analysis notebook in BASE Directory itself

For data preparation of audio features, features_data_preparation.py was used.

NOTE: Do not run the features_data_preparation.py file, as it would need client id, secrect key, etc.

The notebooks can be directly run, as we have provided all the used data.
Install the required dependencies before running notebooks.

just run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
